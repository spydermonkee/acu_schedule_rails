#AcuSchedule

As an acupuncturist, I want to set a template schedule, which will be the default schedule of availability, so that I do not have to always make the schedule.
As an acupuncturist, I want to change the upcoming availability in the schedule, so that I can customize the schedule for the coming week's needs.
As an acupuncturist, I want to see the current schedule with the appointments scheduled by the patients, so that I know who is coming in.
As a patient, I want to check to see which appointments are available, so I can schedule an appointment.
As a patient, I want to have an email confirmation sent to me, so that I am assured that I have the appointment.
As a patient, I want to be able to cancel my appointment within the allowable time period.
As an acupuncturist, I want to set the cancellation window, so that I can have some control over the volatility of my schedule.
